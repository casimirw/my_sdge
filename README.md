# my_sdge
Compare different popular SDGE residential rates plans, using the Green Button Download exported usage file available from the SDGE portal.

- supports non-solar (default) and NEM1.0
- supports both 15-min resolution data and 60-min resolution data
- compares: `TOU-DR1`, `TOU-DR2`, `EV-TOU-5`, `EV-TOU-2`, `DR`(for non-solar user), `DR-SES`(for NEM1.0 user)
- supports SDGE generation + SDGE delivery (represented with plan name) and CCA generation + SDGE delivery (represented with prefix CCA + plan name)
- calculates baseline allowance credit when applicable.
- TAXES & FEES are not included. PCIA is included for CCA option calculation.

## Example
An example 60-min resolution usage file (historical data) is provided.

To use the historical data to compare different plans using the current rates:

```bash
# ensure that you are currently in the downloaded repo folder
python3.9 sdge_hourly.py -f Electric_60_Minute_11-1-2022_11-30-2022_20230819.csv -z coastal --pcia_year 2021
```
Outputs (the plans are ranked from lowest cost to highest cost):
```

## FAQ

### Where to get the 15-min or 60-minute usage csv file?
- Using a desktop computer, sign into your SDGE account.
- Go to https://myaccount.sdge.com/portal/Usage/Index
- Click the `Green Button Download` icon.
- Select the starting date and the ending date.

### Can I use a csv file with continuous data from more than one billing cycles?
Yes. 

Some plans are advantageous in the summer, while others are advantageous in the winter, with a usage file covering more months you can then compare the overall costs of different plans over longer period. 

Just make sure that the starting date and the ending date are spanning no more than one year. The ending date could be from the year following the year of the starting date, but could not include or pass the anniversary.
 
### Which climate zone should I use?
Please check [SDGE's arcgis map](https://sempra.maps.arcgis.com/apps/Embed/index.html?webmap=9c7f4ff6255946d7a86d6fca6934db40&extent=-118.0874,32.5219,-115.6731,33.5248&home=true&zoom=true&scale=true&search=true&searchextent=true&disable_scroll=false&theme=light) : put your address into the search box, click `Enter`, then see the result.

### How can I find the PCIA year?
On your PDF SDGE bill, the year of your PCIA fee is indicated.

For example, on my bill, in the section above "Total Electric Charges", "PCIA 2021" is listed, which means the year is 2021.

As different years have different PCIA fee, if the fee for a particular year is high, it might make the usually slightly cheaper CCA plans slightly more expensive than non-CCA.

### How are the bills calculated?

non-CCA: SDGE generation fee + SDGE delivery fee - allowance credit

CCA: CCA generation fee + SDGE delivery fee - allowance credit + PCIA

NEM1.0: similar to above; uses net consumption instead of consumption for calculations; applies the allowance credit as described in [page 6](https://www.sdge.com/sites/default/files/elec_elec-scheds_nem.pdf).
(the current calculation is estimate only, it has not taken non-bypassable into account yet, so it's NEM1.0)
